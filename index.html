   An Introduction to Python
  </h1>
  <h2>
   History of Python
  </h2>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Christmas 1989: Guido von Rossum started writing a compiler for the Python language.
   </li>
  
  
   <li>
    February 1991: The first Python compiler (also an interpreter) was born. It was implemented in C (behind) and can call C library functions. In the earliest versions, Python has provided support for building blocks such as "classes", "functions", and "exception handling", as well as core data types such as lists and dictionaries, while supporting module-based application construction. .
   </li>
  
  
   <li>
    January 1994: Python 1.0 is officially released.
   </li>
  
  
   <li>
    October 16, 2000: Python 2.0 is released, adding full garbage collection and providing support for Unicode . At the same time, the entire development process of Python is more transparent, the influence of the community on the development progress is gradually expanding, and the ecosystem is slowly forming.
   </li>
  
  
   <li>
    December 3, 2008: Python 3.0 is released, it is not fully compatible with previous Python code, but because there are still many companies using Python 2.x versions in projects and operations, many new versions of Python 3.x Features were later ported to Python 2.6 / 2.7.
   </li>
  
  
   <li>
    The current version of Python 3.8.x we used was released in 2019. The version number of Python is divided into three sections, such as ABC. Among them, A indicates a large version number. Generally, A is added when the overall rewrite or changes that are not backwards compatible; B indicates a function update, and B is added when a new function appears; C indicates a small change (for example: a certain fix Bug), add C whenever possible.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>
   Pros and cons of Python
  </h2>
  <h3>
   The advantages of Python are many, and the simple ones can be summarized as follows.
  </h3>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Simple and clear, there is only one way to do one thing.
   </li>
  
  
   <li>
    The learning curve is low, and Python is easier to learn than many other languages.
   </li>
  
  
   <li>
    Open source, with a strong community and ecosystem.
   </li>
  
  
   <li>
    An interpreted language is inherently platform portable.
   </li>
  
  
   <li>
    Support is provided for two major programming paradigms (object-oriented programming and functional programming).
   </li>
  
  
   <li>
    Extensibility and embeddability. For example, C / C ++ code can be called in Python.
   </li>
  
  
   <li>
    The code is highly standardized and readable, suitable for people with code cleanliness and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
   The disadvantages of Python focus on the following points.
  </h3>
  <ul>
   <li>
    The execution efficiency is slightly lower, so computationally intensive tasks can be written in C / C ++.
   </li>
  
  
   <li>
    The code cannot be encrypted, but many companies now sell software instead of selling software. This problem will be weakened.
   </li>
  
  
   <li>
    There are too many frameworks to choose from during development (for example, there are more than 100 web frameworks), and there are mistakes where there are choices.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>
   Application areas of Python
  </h2>
  <p>
   At present, Python has a wide range of applications in web application development, cloud infrastructure, DevOps, network data collection (reptiles), data analysis and mining, and machine learning. Therefore, it has also produced web back-end development, data interface development, and automated operation and maintenance. , Automated testing, scientific computing and visualization, data analysis, quantitative trading, robotics development, natural language processing, image recognition and a series of related positions.
